#### Summary

Some choropleths of the 2016 US election exploring voter participation by looking at both the number and percentage of ballots with votes for highest office, out of total voter-age population (VAP).

Done just for fun and a chance to explore choropleths in Python.

Some rough interpretation:

  * Red-Red States: These states saw increases in both turnout rates and population. This can be interpreted as an overall more involved population.
  * Red-Blue States: These states saw an increase in turnout rate despite slower growth or reduction in population. This can be interpreted as a state waning in relative population but increasing political involvement.
  * Blue-Red States: These states saw a decrease in turnout rate despite higher growth in population. This can be interpreted as an indication of withdrawal from national politics.
  * Blue-Blue States: These states saw decreases in both turnout rates and population. This can be interpreted as a state generally waning overall.

  "2012-2016 Comparison of Turnout Rate Change to VAP Change")

Comparatively:

  * Yellow states saw increasing turnout rates, decreasing populations.
  * Purple states saw decreasing turnout rates, increasing populations.
  * Teal states would be those whose turnout rates and populations changed at the same rate, either increasing or decreasing together.

There's definitely room for continuation. Using given data, this could Looking at Voting-Eligible Population (VEP), which offers some correction for non-citizens and felons.
It would also be interesting to have more data; for one, the breakdown between Democrat and Republican. Also, more information about votes for US Senators and Republicans, and then state politicians.
